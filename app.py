    This project, **"Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations in E-Commerce"**,
    aims to analyze e-commerce transaction data to understand customer purchasing behaviors,
    segment customers, and recommend relevant products.

    **Key Objectives:**
    * Uncover patterns in customer purchase behavior.
    * Segment customers using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis.
    * Develop a product recommendation system using collaborative filtering.

    **Technologies Used:**
    * **Python:** Core programming language.
    * **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and numerical operations.
    * **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning algorithms (KMeans for clustering, Cosine Similarity).
    * **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
    * **Streamlit:** For building interactive web applications.

    **Customer Segments:**
    * **High-Value:** Customers with low Recency, high Frequency, and high Monetary values.
    * **Regular:** Customers with medium Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
    * **Occasional:** Customers with low Frequency and Monetary values, but not necessarily very high Recency (may still be relatively recent).
    * **At-Risk:** Customers with high Recency and low Frequency and Monetary values, indicating they haven't purchased in a long time and are not frequent/high spenders.

    This application demonstrates the power of data analytics and machine learning in enhancing
    e-commerce strategies and customer engagement.
